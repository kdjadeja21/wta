  - ❌ Invalid: "J", "John123", "Test@Name"

### Email Verification
- Verification email sent via Firebase Auth
- Email must be verified before login allowed
- Resend verification has rate limiting (Firebase built-in)
- No custom verification codes needed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Email Verification
- Uses `sendEmailVerification(user)` from Firebase Auth
- Firebase handles email template and sending
- Verification link directs to Firebase-hosted page
- After verification, user can close page and login
- No action URLs or custom handlers needed

### Database Structure
```
users/
  {userId}/
    profile/
      data:
        - email: string
        - username: string
        - firstName?: string  ← NEW
        - lastName?: string   ← NEW
        - height?: number
        - goalWeight?: number
        - createdAt: Timestamp
        - updatedAt: Timestamp
    weights/
      {weightId}: {...}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- `firstName` and `lastName` are optional fields
- Existing users without these fields will see "Not set"
- Can add firstname/lastname anytime via Profile page
- No migration needed for existing users

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: New User Signup
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Fill in all fields (including firstname/lastname)
3. Submit form
4. Verify redirect to `/verify-email`
5. Check email for verification link
6. Click verification link
7. Return to app and login
8. Verify successful login and access to dashboard

### Test 2: Email Verification Required
1. Create new account
2. Try to login immediately (before verifying)
3. Should see error about email verification
4. Login should be blocked
5. Verify email via link
6. Try login again
7. Should succeed

### Test 3: Profile Update
1. Login to existing account
2. Go to `/profile`
3. Click "Update" on First Name
4. Enter new first name
5. Click Save
6. Verify success message
7. Verify display updates
8. Repeat for Last Name
9. Refresh page - verify changes persist

### Test 4: Resend Verification
1. Create new account
2. On `/verify-email` page
3. Click "Resend Verification Email"
4. Check email for new verification link
5. Verify second email received

### Test 5: Validation
1. On signup page, try invalid names:
   - Single character: "A"
   - With numbers: "John123"
   - With special chars: "Test@Name"
2. Verify appropriate error messages
3. Try valid names and verify acceptance

## Configuration Required

### Firebase Console
No additional configuration needed. Email verification is a built-in Firebase Auth feature.

Optional: Customize email template in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Authentication → Templates → Email address verification
2. Customize subject and content
3. Add custom domain (optional)

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed. Uses existing Firebase config.

## Bug Fixes

### Issue: Redirect Loop on Signup
**Problem:** After signup, user was briefly redirected to dashboard then back to login, causing confusion.

**Root Cause:** Race condition between:
1. Firebase creating user (triggers `onAuthStateChanged`)
2. Signup page's `useEffect` detecting user and redirecting to dashboard
3. `signup()` function calling `signOut()` to enforce email verification

**Solution:** Updated the `useEffect` in signup page to only redirect if:
- User exists AND
- Email is verified AND  
- Not currently in loading state (signup process)

This prevents the race condition while still allowing verified users to access dashboard.

## Known Limitations

1. **Email Template:** Uses default Firebase email template (can be customized in Firebase Console)
2. **Resend Rate Limiting:** Firebase enforces rate limits on verification emails (cannot customize)
3. **Name Validation:** Current regex allows most international names but may not cover all edge cases
4. **No Email Change:** If user enters wrong email, they must create a new account

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Display full name (firstname + lastname) in navbar or profile header
2. Add ability to change email address with re-verification
3. Add custom verification page with app branding
4. Add SMS verification option
5. Add social login options (Google, Apple, etc.)
6. Support for international characters in names (Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.)
7. Add profile picture upload
8. Add "Display Name" field separate from firstname/lastname

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Verification email not received
**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Wait a few minutes (emails can be delayed)
3. Use "Resend Verification Email" button
4. Check email address is correct
5. Verify Firebase project has email sending enabled

### Issue: Can't login after verification
**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Try different browser
3. Check Firebase Console → Authentication to verify email is marked as verified
4. Try password reset if password might be wrong

### Issue: Names with apostrophes or hyphens rejected
**Solutions:**
1. This should work - verify validation regex is correct
2. Check for leading/trailing spaces
3. Ensure using straight apostrophe (') not curly quotes ('')
